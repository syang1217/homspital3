## 3. Core Problems

List the top problems from the user's perspective.

### Problem 1
- **Description**: In emergency situations, people do not know what to do immediately.

## 4. Existing Alternatives

How users solve this problem today.

### Tools, Workflows, or Hacks
- Searching portals (Google, Naver) for keywords like “essential first-aid medicine” or “burn first aid”
- Watching YouTube videos, blog posts, or card-style infographics
- Referring to government or fire department PDF manuals or posters
- Saving screenshots of emergency checklists
- Reading paper manuals included in emergency kits

### Manual Processes or Human Workarounds
- Calling family members, friends, or neighbors for help
- Relying on remembered advice from past emergency experiences
- Making spontaneous decisions based on personal judgment
- Depending on general safety knowledge remembered from the past

### Doing Nothing / Tolerating the Pain
- Freezing in panic and waiting for the situation to pass
- Assuming emergencies will not happen again and skipping preparation
- Purchasing emergency kits without learning how to actually use them

### True Competition
What users would actually choose instead of a new solution.

- **Search Engines**
  - Fast access, but information is fragmented and lacks situational prioritization
- **YouTube & Social Media**
  - Easy to understand visually, but not real-time or tailored; trust varies widely
- **Existing Emergency Kits + Paper Manuals**
  - Physical preparation exists, but reading and 판단 during a crisis is unrealistic
- **People (Family, Friends, Experts)**
  - Trusted, but not always reachable and cannot guarantee immediate response

## 5. Decision Criteria & Tradeoffs

How users decide whether to solve this problem.

### What Users Care About Most
- **Speed (Most Important)**  
  In emergencies, users need guidance within seconds. Complex searching or input is unacceptable.
- **Trust & Credibility**  
  Incorrect information is dangerous; guidance must be reliable.
- **Clarity & Actionability**  
  Users prefer clear, immediate actions over long explanations.
- **Context Awareness**  
  Guidance should adapt to the user’s situation (location, target person, available kit).
- **Control & Reassurance**  
  Users want guidance while retaining a sense of personal judgment and control.

### What Users Are Willing to Sacrifice
- Perfect accuracy in favor of immediate usability
- Academic completeness in favor of practical, usable instructions
- Deep personalization if it requires lengthy setup
- Visual polish in favor of readability and function
- Multiple features in favor of solving one situation extremely well

### Why Existing Solutions Are “Good Enough” — and Where They Fail

**Why Search Engines & Manuals Seem Sufficient**
- Free
- Highly accessible
- Familiar

**Where They Fail**
- Users must interpret and prioritize information themselves
- No situation-specific decision guidance
- No connection between emergency kits and real-time action
- Require thinking and 판단 at the moment of highest panic

## 6. Stakes & Opportunity

What happens if this problem is not solved.

### Impact on Individual Users
- **Direct risk to life and physical safety**  
  Delayed or incorrect responses can lead to serious injury or death.
- **Extreme anxiety and helplessness**  
  Not knowing what to do amplifies fear and can cause lasting trauma.
- **Loss of confidence in preparation**  
  Having an emergency kit but failing to use it effectively undermines trust in preparedness.
- **Post-event regret and repeated mistakes**  
  “I should have done X” becomes a recurring outcome.

### Impact on Teams or Organizations
- **Reduced product effectiveness**  
  Emergency kits become “objects that exist” rather than tools that help.
- **Lack of learning loop for improvement**  
  No insight into which components fail in real situations.
- **Failure to differentiate**  
  Physical kits alone are easily commoditized and price-competed.
- **Social responsibility risk**  
  Brands focused on safety lose credibility if they fail to help when it matters.

### Scale of the Opportunity If Solved Well
- Expansion from “emergency kits” to “emergency response systems”
- Transition from one-time product sales to ongoing services
- AI systems that work even without large-scale data
- Expansion from B2C to B2B and B2G (homes, companies, schools, public institutions, travel/hospitality)
- Long-term trust-based brand equity as “the brand that actually helps in emergencies”
